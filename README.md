MtCars Dataset

Description:
This project analyzes the mtcars dataset, which contains various attributes of car models such as miles per gallon, horsepower, weight, and transmission type. The goal of this analysis is to explore relationships between different variables, identify trends, and visualize key insights using statistical and graphical methods.

Objective:
Investigate how factors like engine displacement, number of cylinders, and transmission type impact fuel efficiency (mpg).
Analyze the distribution of car attributes and their correlations.
Compare insights from both Python and R-based analyses.

Technologies Used:
Python & R
Jupyter Notebook & R Studio
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Python) | tidyverse, ggplot2 (R)
